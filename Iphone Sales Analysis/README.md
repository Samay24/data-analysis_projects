# 📱 iPhone Sales Project

## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes iPhone sales data to uncover key business insights. It uses Python and libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to explore sales performance, pricing trends, and revenue breakdowns across various iPhone models and storage configurations.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains details on iPhone models, including:

- `Model` – iPhone model name (e.g., iPhone 11, 12 Pro Max)
- `Storage` – Storage capacity (64GB, 128GB, etc.)
- `Price` – Selling price in INR
- `Units Sold` – Number of units sold
- `Revenue` – Computed field (Price × Units Sold)

## 📈 Key Analysis Performed

- 📌 **Revenue Analysis**: Total and average revenue by model and storage variant.
- 🔍 **Top Selling Models**: Identification of the most popular iPhones based on units sold.
- 📊 **Price vs Units Sold**: Visualization of pricing impact on sales.
- 📦 **Storage-wise Revenue Distribution**: Breakdown of how different storage options contribute to overall revenue.
- 🏆 **Best Performing Variant**: Based on revenue contribution.

## 📷 Visualizations

The project includes various charts such as:

- Bar plots for revenue comparison
- Pie charts for sales share
- Bubble plot for discount percentage 


## ✅ Conclusions

- Mid-range iPhones (e.g., iPhone 11 and 12) with 128GB storage are among the top performers.
- There's a balance point between price and units sold — high-priced models sell less but generate more per unit.
- Higher storage variants contribute significantly to total revenue.
